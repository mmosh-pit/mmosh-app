      home jurisdiction. By using our site, you acknowledge and agree to such

    <h2 className="my-4">YOUR CHOICES</h2>

    <h3>Cookies</h3>

    <p>
      Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can
      usually set your browser to disable cookies, or to alert you when cookies
      are being sent. Likewise, most mobile devices allow you to disable the
      ability for geolocation information to be collected from your mobile
      device. The help function on most browsers and mobile devices contains
      instructions on how to set your browser to notify you before accepting
      cookies, disable cookies entirely, or disable the collection of
      geolocation data. You need to set each browser, on each device you use to
      surf the Web. Thus, if you use multiple browsers (e.g., Chrome, Safari,
      Internet Explorer, Firefox, etc.), you should repeat this procedure with
      each one. Similarly, if you connect to the Web from multiple devices
      (e.g., work and home), you need to set each browser on each device.
      Depending on your jurisdiction, you may be able to utilize additional
      cookie management tools. Please note that removing or rejecting cookies
      could affect the availability and functionality of our Website.

      <li>
        When we have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data to
