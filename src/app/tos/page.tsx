      <h2>AGREEMENT TO TERMS</h2>

      <p>
        This End User License Agreement and Terms of Service (“EULA” or “Terms”)
        is a binding contract between you, an individual user or site visitor,
        whether personally or on behalf of an entity (“user,” “you,” “your”) and
        Liquid Hearts Club (“LHC,” “we,” “us” or “our”) concerning use of the
        our services (the “Service”), including this website as well as any
        other media form, media channel, bot, app or mobile website related,
        linked, or otherwise connected thereto (collectively, the “Site”).
        Currently, LHC maintains and operates{" "}
        <a href="https://liquidhearts.app" target="_blank">
          https://liquidhearts.app
        </a>{" "}
        as an opt-in service for creating, sharing, buying and selling community
        coins and memecoins.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the avoidance of doubt, LHC does not control the Massively
        Multiplayer On-chain Shared Hallucination (“MMOSH”) protocol on which we
        operate, Telegram or any other systems, networks, apps, protocols,
        devices or platforms on which we might appear. LHC cannot control
        activity and data on MMOSH, the activities of persons who develop and
        use applications on MMOSH, the distribution of royalties on MMOSH, or
        use of MMOSH. MMOSH is an open-source protocol that was developed and is
        maintained by LHC. The genesis ecosystem for the MMOSH Protocol is MMOSH
        DAO. Any third party may develop applications, protocols, networks and
        services that use MMOSH, so our tokens and other materials may appear in
        various contexts outside our control.

        <strong>
          BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ,
          UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE EULA. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE,
          PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SERVICE OR SITE.

      </p>

      <p>
        Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the
        Site from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by
        reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes
        or modifications to this EULA at any time and for any reason. We will
        alert you about any changes by updating the “Last updated” date of the
        EULA, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such
        change. It is your responsibility to periodically review the EULA to
        stay informed of updates. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to
        have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised
        EULA by your continued use of the Service after the date such revised
        EULA is posted.
      </p>

      <p>
        The information provided on the Site is not intended for distribution to
        or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such
        distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which
        would subject us to any registration requirement within such
        jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access
        the Site from other locations do so on their own initiative and are
        solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent

        agree that by using the Site and the Service you are at least 18 years
        of age, or accessing the Service under the supervision of a parent or
        guardian, and you are legally able to enter into a contract. If you are
        a parent or legal guardian of a user under the age of 18 (or the age of
        legal majority), you agree to be fully responsible for the acts or
        omissions of such user in relation to the Service. If you use the
        Service on behalf of another person or entity, (a) all references to
        “you” throughout the EULA will include that person or entity, (b) you
        represent that you are authorized to accept these Terms on that person’s
        or entity’s behalf, and (c) in the event you or the person or entity
        violates these Terms, the person or entity agrees to be responsible to
        us.

      <h2>SITE MANAGEMENT</h2>

      <p>
        We reserve the right, but not the obligation, to: (1) monitor the Site
        for violations of this EULA; (2) take appropriate legal action against
        anyone who, in our sole discretion, violates the law or this EULA,
        including without limitation, reporting such user to law enforcement
        authorities; (3) in our sole discretion and without limitation, notice,
        or liability, to remove from the Site or otherwise disable all files and
        content that are excessive in size or are in any way burdensome to our
        systems; and (4) otherwise manage the Site in a manner designed to
        protect our rights and property and to facilitate the proper functioning
        of the Site.
      </p>

      <h2>TRADEMARKS</h2>

      <p>
        “Liquid Hearts Club” and our logos, our product or service names, our
        slogans and the look and feel of the Service are trademarks of LCH and
        may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without our
        prior written permission, which may be obtained by emailing Liquid
        Hearts Club, our technical partners, at support@liquidhearts.club. All
        other trademarks, registered trademarks, product names and company names
        or logos mentioned on the Service are the property of their respective
        owners. Reference to any products, services, processes or other
        information by trade name, trademark, manufacturer, supplier or
        otherwise does not constitute or imply endorsement, sponsorship or
        recommendation by us.
      </p>

      <h2>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>

      <p>
        Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to
        arbitrate certain disputes and claims with LHC and limits the manner in
        which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by
        following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative
        actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration provision. In
        addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury
        trial.
      </p>

      <p>
        (a) No Representative Actions. You and LHC agree that any dispute
        arising out of or related to this EULA or the Service is personal to you
        and LHC and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual
        action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or
        any other type of representative proceeding.
      </p>

      <p>
        (b) Arbitration of Disputes. You and LHC waive your rights to a jury
        trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or related to this
        EULA and the Service, including claims related to privacy and data
        security, (collectively, “Disputes”) resolved in court. Instead, for any
        Dispute that you have against LHC you agree to first contact LHC and
        attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of
        your claim (“Notice”) to LHC by email at support@liquidhearts.club or by
        US mail addressed to Liquid Hearts Club, P.O. Box 2085, Shepherdstown,
        WV 25443. The Notice must (a) include your name, residence address,
        email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis
        of the Dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice
        to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and LHC
        cannot reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days
        after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the Dispute
        to binding arbitration administered by JAMS or, under the limited
        circumstances set forth above, in court. All Disputes submitted to JAMS
        will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one
        arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in Martinsburg, WV. You
        and LHC agree that Disputes will be held in accordance with the JAMS
        Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“JAMS Rules”). The most
        recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on the JAMS website and
        are hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree
        that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your
        opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS
        Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.
      </p>

      <p>
        (c) You and LHC agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and
        that the enforceability of this Section will be substantively and
        procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et
        seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As
        limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will
        have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive
        decisions regarding any Dispute and to grant any remedy that would
        otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the
        question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual
        arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims,
        preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside
        over any proceeding involving more than one individual.
      </p>

      <p>
        (d) The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of
        non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute. The arbitrator, LHC,
        and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration
        proceedings, judgments and awards, including information gathered,
        prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the
        Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make
        appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law
        provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to
        the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the
        arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court
        application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial
        challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent
        that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.
      </p>

      <p>
        (e) You and LHC agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will
        pay the filing fee (up to a maximum of $250 if you are a consumer), and
        LHC will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration
        initiated by LHC, LHC will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and LHC
        agree that the State of West Virginia shall have exclusive jurisdiction
        over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.
      </p>

      <p>
        (f) Any Dispute must be filed within one year after the relevant claim
        arose; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred, which means that
        you and LHC will not have the right to assert the claim.
      </p>

      <p>
        (g) You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days
        of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section by mailing an
        opt-out notice to LHC at P.O. Box 2085, Shepherdstown, WV 25443. In
        order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name
        and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding
        arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to
        resolve Disputes in accordance with the governing law and venue terms of
        this EULA.
      </p>

      <p>
        (h) If any portion of this Section is found to be unenforceable or
        unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision
        shall be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or
        unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of
        this Section or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any
        remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section; and
        (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class,
        collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be
        litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in
        arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall
        be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.
        Further, if any part of this Section is found to prohibit an individual
        claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no
        effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of
        arbitration, and the remainder of this Section will be enforceable.
      </p>

      <h2>GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE</h2>

      <p>
        Any dispute arising from these Terms and your use of the Service will be
        governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of
        Delaware, USA. Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to
        arbitration will be resolved in Martinsburg, WV, USA.
      </p>

      <h2>CORRECTIONS</h2>

      <p>
        There may be information on the Site that contains typographical errors,
        inaccuracies, or omissions, including descriptions, pricing,
        availability, and various other information. We reserve the right to

      <p>
        LHC may link to products and services offered by third parties through
        the Service. These third-party products and services are not offered by

      </p>

      <p>
        You shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542 or any
        other similar law of any jurisdiction, which says in substance: “A
        general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not
        know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the
        release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his
        settlement with the debtor.” Some jurisdictions do not allow the
        exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusion may not apply to
        you. You may have other rights which vary from jurisdiction to
        jurisdiction.
      </p>

      <h2>INDEMNIFICATION</h2>

        or arising out of: (1) use of the Service; (2) breach of this EULA; (3)
        any breach of your representations and warranties set forth in this
        EULA; (4) your violation of the rights of a third party, including but
        not limited to intellectual property rights; (5) any overt harmful act
        toward any other user of the Service with whom you connected via the
        Service; or (6) any breach of, or failure to comply with, applicable
        law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right, at your
        expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for
        which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate, at
        your expense, with our defense of such claims. We will use reasonable
        efforts to notify you of any such claim, action, or proceeding which is
        subject to this indemnification upon becoming aware of it.

        This EULA and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the Site
        or in respect to the Service constitute the entire agreement and
        understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any
        right or provision of this EULA shall not operate as a waiver of such
        right or provision. This EULA operates to the fullest extent permissible
        by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others
        at any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage,
        delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable
        control. If any provision or part of a provision of this EULA is
        determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or
        part of the provision is deemed severable from this EULA and does not
        affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
        There is no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency
        relationship created between you and us as a result of this EULA or use
        of the Service. You agree that this EULA will not be construed against
        us by virtue of having drafted them. You hereby waive any and all
        defenses you may have based on the electronic form of this EULA and the
        lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute this EULA.
